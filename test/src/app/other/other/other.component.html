<div class="testContainer">
  <p>You're viewing OtherComponent from OtherModule which was loaded lazily upon hitting /othermodule</p>
  <p>The background color is set in testConfig.json and compiled into SCSS.</p>
  <p>Can you set a breakpoint in Visual Studio Code on other.component.ts:14 and reach it ? I can't with my current webpack.config.js and launch.json configurations </p>
  </div>
